                <p>I'm a music researcher who focuses primarily on computational methods for music analysis. 
                The most interesting results for me are when my models misalign with my musical intuition; 
                in my research, I continue to interrogate that misalignment, whether that's a bias of the model or a 
                subjective priority of my own. I am an Assistant Professor of Music Theory at Baldwin Wallace University. 
                Before BW, I taught at the University of Illinois, Union College, the Eastman School of Music (Ph.D), and 
                Boston University (MM).
                </br></br>

                In my free time I like to take photos, bird watch, and play piano with my 4-hands partner (and partner) Eron.
