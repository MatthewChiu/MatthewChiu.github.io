                <p>I'm a music researcher who focuses primarily on computational methods for music analysis. 
                The most interesting results for me are when my models misalign with my musical intuition; 
                in my research, I continue to interrogate that misalignment, whether that's a bias of the model or a 
                subjective priority of my own. I'm currently a Ph.D. student in music theory at the Eastman School of Music, 
                where I'm currently working on my dissertation with Davy Temperley and serving as co-editor to Int√©gral.
                Next year I will join the faculty at the University of Illinois, Urbana/Champaign. </br></br>

                In my free time I like to take photos, bird watch, and play piano with my 4-hands partner (and partner) Eron.
